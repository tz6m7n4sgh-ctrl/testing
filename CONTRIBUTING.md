# Contributing

Thank you for improving LaunchOps Control Tower. This repository is maintained as a portfolio-grade, production-shaped project rather than a throwaway demo.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a focused branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes small enough to review.
3. Run the local quality gates before opening a pull request.
4. Update README, architecture, or operations notes when behavior changes.

## Quality Gates

- Health checks must pass.
- Tests must pass or the pull request must explain the missing coverage.
- Build checks must pass for user-facing changes.
- New runtime configuration must be documented in `.env.example`.

## Review Standards

Reviewers should look for correctness, operational risk, privacy impact, accessibility, and whether the change keeps the project understandable for future maintainers.
