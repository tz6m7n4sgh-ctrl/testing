# Enterprise Readiness

LaunchOps Control Tower is organized around the engineering qualities that make a repository credible beyond a small demo.

## Architecture Signals

- Clear separation between user interface, service logic, tests, documentation, and operational scripts.
- Repeatable local setup through documented commands.
- CI checks that cover health, tests, and build paths where applicable.
- Explicit safety and contribution expectations for maintainers.

## Operational Signals

- `ops:check` or an equivalent health command verifies repository readiness.
- Configuration examples live in `.env.example` when the project needs runtime secrets.
- Operational notes explain deployment, monitoring, rollback, and data-handling expectations.

## Portfolio Signals

- The README should communicate the real-world problem, not just the stack.
- Tests and evaluation scenarios should demonstrate behavior that matters to users.
- Docs should make the project easy to assess in a few minutes and easy to run in under an hour.
